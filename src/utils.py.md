# Documentation for `.\src\utils.py`

## Overview

This file provides utility functions to interact with and traverse directories in the filesystem, specifically focusing on identifying and formatting file outputs. It includes a mechanism to filter and print files based on their extensions and visibility, particularly highlighting code file types.

## Global Variables

- `CODE_EXTENSIONS`: This set defines a comprehensive collection of file extensions typically associated with programming and markup languages. It serves as a reference to identify code-related files across various languages.

## Functions

### `find_files(path, tabs, hidden=False, all_=True, extensions=None)`

This function recursively traverses a directory, printing its contents while distinguishing between files and directories. It supports various filtering options.

#### Parameters:

- `path`: The root directory path from which the search starts.
- `tabs`: An integer representing the indentation level for nested files and directories, aiding in visual hierarchy during printing.
- `hidden` (optional, default `False`): A boolean indicating whether hidden files (those starting with a dot) should be included in the output.
- `all_` (optional, default `True`): A boolean that, when False, will filter the output to only include files with extensions present in the `extensions` list (or `CODE_EXTENSIONS` if `extensions` is `None`).
- `extensions` (optional): A set or list of file extensions to filter the files. If not provided, it defaults to the `CODE_EXTENSIONS` set.

#### Functionality:

- Iterates over the contents of the specified directory.
- Checks whether each item is a directory or file.
- Uses `should_print()` to determine whether the item should be printed.
- Recursively calls itself if a directory is encountered to continue the traversal.

### `is_code_file(filename, extensions)`

Determines whether a given file is considered a code file based on its extension.

#### Parameters:

- `filename`: The name of the file to check.
- `extensions`: A collection of file extensions to match against.

#### Returns:

- A boolean: `True` if the file has an extension present in `extensions`, otherwise `False`.

### `should_print(filename, hidden, all_, is_dir, extensions)`

Decides whether a file or directory should be printed based on various criteria.

#### Parameters:

- `filename`: The name of the file or directory.
- `hidden`: A boolean indicating if hidden files should be considered.
- `all_`: A boolean reflecting whether all files should be included or just code files.
- `is_dir`: A boolean indicating if the item is a directory.
- `extensions`: A list of file extensions to filter the files against.

#### Returns:

- A boolean: `True` if the file or directory should be printed, otherwise `False`.

#### Functionality:

- Always returns `True` for directories if `hidden` is `True`.
- Skips hidden files if `hidden` is `False`.
- Filters non-code files when `all_` is `False` and only prints files with extensions in `extensions` (or `CODE_EXTENSIONS`).

This code equips developers with the ability to traverse directories efficiently and conditionally display files based on visibility and file type criteria.
