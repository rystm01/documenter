# Documentation for `.\src\document.py`

This Python script contains a class named `Documenter` designed for generating markdown documentation for code files in a project. The class utilizes several AI models to create detailed documentation and summary of code functionalities, which it writes to markdown files. The script is structured as follows:

### Imports

- **`Anthropic`, `OpenAI`, `Together`**: These imports indicate the use of different AI models available from these modules for generating documentation and summaries.
- **`os`**: Imported for handling file and directory operations.
- **`re`**: This module is typically used for regular expression operations but does not appear directly in the provided code.
- **`should_print`**: A utility function likely used to determine whether a file should be processed, imported from `src.utils`.

### `Documenter` Class

#### Class Constants

- **`SYSTEM_PROMPT`**: This class-level constant holds the prompt template guiding AI models for generating documentation.

#### Constructor: `__init__`

- **Parameters**: `path`, `api_key`, `filewise`, `provider`, and `model`.
- **Attributes**: 
  - Sets up various instance attributes such as file path, markdown content, a counter for files (`self.num`), and others related to API keys, providers, and models.
  - Initializes a file named "documently_summary" to store summaries of code files.

#### Destructor: `__del__`

- **Purpose**: Cleans up by removing environment variable associated with the API key when the `Documenter` instance is destroyed.

#### Private Method: `_read_file`

- **Purpose**: Helper function to read the contents of a file and return it as a string.

#### Private Method: `_document_file`

- **Purpose**: Generates markdown documentation for a specific file using the specified AI provider.
- **Functionality**:
  - Handles communication with the chosen AI model (Claude, OpenAI, or Together) to get the documentation and summary.
  - Writes the summary to "documently_summary" and the documentation to a markdown file.

#### Public Method: `document`

- **Parameters**: `path`, `tabs`, `hidden`, `all_`, `extensions`.
- **Purpose**: Recursively documents all files in a directory as determined by the `should_print` utility and writes their documentation.

#### Public Method: `summarize`

- **Purpose**: Uses AI to summarize the entire project's code based on the individual file summaries collected in "documently_summary".
- **Output**: Writes the summary of the entire project to `project_summary.md`.

#### Private Method: `write_md`

- **Purpose**: Writes the markdown documentation to a specified file, either structured per file or as a single consolidated document.

### Summary

The `Documenter` class provides a streamlined way of generating documentation for code files using various AI models. The class is designed to handle file and directory operations, integrate with AI services through API keys, and produce both individual file documentation and overall project summaries. The outputs are intended to be saved in markdown format for easy readability and sharing.
