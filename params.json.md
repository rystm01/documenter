## File Name: params.json

This JSON configuration file comprises several key-value pairs that are used to set various parameters for an application or service. Here's a breakdown of each parameter and its intended use:

- **root**: A string indicating the filename or the main root directory/file to be used. This could be the base or entry point for the application.

- **github**: A string containing the URL or link to a associated GitHub repository. This can be used to reference code management, version control, or project hosting on GitHub.

- **hidden**: A boolean value represented as a string ("bool") to specify if certain elements should be hidden. This might control visibility settings within the application.

- **all**: A boolean value represented as a string ("bool") that might determine if an operation should apply to all items or entries, as opposed to a subset.

- **langs**: An array of languages specified by strings (e.g., ["lang1", "lang2"]). This could be used to define supported programming languages, localization languages, or other categorical sets.

- **api_key**: A string representing an API key. This key is used to authenticate API requests and should be kept secure.

- **provider**: A string specifying the name of a provider or service. This parameter is likely used to determine which external service or API to interface with.

- **filewise**: A boolean value represented as a string ("bool") that might control whether operations and configurations are determined or applied on a per-file basis.

This JSON structure facilitates configuring and managing the behavior of an application in a flexible and centralized manner. Each parameter is essential for different configuration aspects, contributing to the functionality and customization of the software environment.
